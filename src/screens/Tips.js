          The first time you burn your candle, allow the wax to melt all the way
          to the edge
          <p>of the vessel for the best diffusion and burning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Although our candles burn evenly from top to bottom, you should not
          burn them
          <p>for more than four hours at a time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          When lighting a candle for the first time, burn it long enough to make
          the top layer completely
          <p>
            liquid. Because of this, the candle will burn evenly
            throughout its lifetime.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          To re-center or straighten the wick, use a sturdy object. Pour the
          liquid wax out 
          <p>carefully if the flame is too small.</p>
